# Blueberry Pancakes Are Really Amazing
Blueberry pancakes are the best kind of pancakes even though, I think vanilla
pancakes are really great too.

The last time I had a pancake, they were vanilla pancakes but I really wanted to have blueberry pancakes. It was great though, with the maple syrup and all the other accompanying fruits on it. I ate to my fill and I had it with some really delicious cappuccino that had that wake-y feeling that i suspect was given by the cinnamon added to it. 

I had an amazing time making it too. Yes, I made the pancakes I'm rambling about by myself. I don't know why I decided to make vanilla instead of blueberry pancakes. 

And how about strawberry pancakes, they are super delicious I can't help myself with them and maybe that's why I don't eat them that much. They can be very addicting. They are great though, you should try them when you get the chance to. 

This is where I end my rambling about pancakes for this post. See you in my next post, next week. 

Adios!!
